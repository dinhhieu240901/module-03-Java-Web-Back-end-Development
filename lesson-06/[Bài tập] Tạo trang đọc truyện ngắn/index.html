        <h5>Chapter 1: A world hunter-human</h5>
        <p>In a world where hunters — human warriors who possess supernatural abilities — must battle deadly monsters to protect mankind from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the extremely rare ability to level up in strength and turn anyone he kills into a loyal minion called a shadow. Jinwoo then sets out on a journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers..</p>

        <h5>Chapter 2: Solo Leveling: Ragnarok</h5>
        <p> April 2023, Kakao announced a sequel titled Solo Leveling: Ragnarok. The web novel were released through KakaoPage on April 10, 2023.[63][64] A webtoon adaptation is set to premiere in 2024.[6]

            The story is set after the events of Solo Leveling; the side story acts as a prelude. Sung Su-ho, the son of Sung Jing-woo and Cha Hae-in, inherited his father's powers as the Shadow Monarch. However, his powers and memories were locked as a child, so he can have a normal life. But when Gates started to open up around Earth again during his third year of university, Su-ho is chosen as a Player by the System. Therefore, Su-ho must become a Hunter in order to face the new threat that is related to his parents' disappearance.[65]

            The web novel is written by Daul, who replaced Chugong, the writer of the original Solo Leveling web novel. Chugong revealed he decided to support Daul, saying he still experienced the same emotions he felt when he first began serializing the original web novel.[66] The first 105 chapters debuted on KakaoPage on April 10, 2023.[67]</p>

        <h5>Chapter 3: The Gate: Heaven and Hell</h5>
        <p>Ten years ago, "the Gate" appeared and connected the real world with the realm of magic and monsters. To combat these vile beasts, ordinary people received superhuman powers and became known as "Hunters." Twenty-year-old Sung Jin-Woo is one such Hunter, but he is known as the "World's Weakest," owing to his pathetic power compared to even a measly E-Rank. Still, he hunts monsters tirelessly in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother's medical bills.
